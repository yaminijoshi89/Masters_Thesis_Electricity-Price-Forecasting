# Masters_Thesis: Comparative Study of ML/AI Models for day-ahead Electricity-Price-Forecasting in the German market
This repository is created to document my master's thesis-related datasets and code. 
Once completed, it will be made public for future use, improvements, and research. 

Model's used : 
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA)
- Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)
- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Prophet
- DeepAR
- Wavelet-Transform-Based Models
- Generalized Additive Model (GAM)

Variables:
- Day-ahead price: ENTSO-E provides day-ahead transmission prices at 15-min, 30-min, and hourly intervals.
- Fuel Prices (Gas, coal): 
- Load 
- Installed Capacity per Production Type
- Generation: Generation forecast for wind and solar , Generation forecast for day-ahead
- Weather -> Temperature
- Calendar variables: Weekday, Weekend

Data Source: ENTSO-E (open-source)
